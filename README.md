# TCBN-Model

## Goal

The purpose of this work is to implement and combine two previous computational models ([Mandali et al., 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2015.00191/full); [Farokhniaee and Lowery, 2021](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/abee50/data)) to study via simulations the effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on the  Thalamus-Cortical-Basal-Nuclei (TCBN) system.

## Methods
- [x] Implement the Izhikevich Neuron model;
- [ ] Implement the FL Model (Thalamocortical model);
- [ ] Implement the Madali et al Model (Basal Ganglia model);
- [ ] Coupling the two models to produce a model for the TCBN circuit;
- [ ] Study the effects of DBS with the model obtained.
